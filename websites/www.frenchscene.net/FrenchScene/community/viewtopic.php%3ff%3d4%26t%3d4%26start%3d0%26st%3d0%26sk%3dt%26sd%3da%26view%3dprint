				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">To get everyone on the same page, I will in this topic introduce the reasons why I founded this site and where I see this site going.</span><br /><br />First of all, English is not my native language, my native language is Dutch. I'm learning French for a while now and it is in this context that I got in touch with French music.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">For who?</span><br /><br />This site is a clear effort to bring the French music scene to an international public. I found that there is an enormous lack of information about the French music scene on the internet, the only decent websites are completely in French. <br />I chose to make this site in English because English is such an international language, this site does not only target US but as I said an international English speaking audience.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The Content</span><br /><br />My idea is to make a site with lots of information covering almost every angle of the scene. FrenchScene.Net should eventually become a site with lots and lots of content <span style="font-weight: bold">and</span> an active community that will participate in the content creation.<br /><br />So what will be on the site? (in order of piority)<br /><br />-<span style="font-weight: bold"> A broad artist and song database </span>that will contain mainstream, unsigned and underground artists. One of biggest challenges here is to create a clear separation of the mainstream and  underground artists. Remember that most of the people visiting our site will be completely new to the scene. So you could put for instance Vanessa Paradis and an artist who has just one unsigned record in the same context, this would really be confusing to our visitors.<br /><br />- <span style="font-weight: bold">News from the scene</span>. Is there an important artist that just released an album? Who won the French music awards? This kind of information should be on this site. <br /><br />- <span style="font-weight: bold">Great Moments in the history of French music</span>, in this section we will try to bring together (through YouTube videos) some of the best moments, such as unforgettable concerts <br /><br />-  <span style="font-weight: bold">An articles section. </span>To get more solid content we should also focuss on writing some articles for instance 'best French radio stations' , 'top French songs about paris'  etc. These articles could eventually come from topics in the forums.<br /><br />- <span style="font-weight: bold">Small sections</span> like 'What's in the charts' (someone could write for instance every month an overview of what's popular in France)  or 'The French Megamix' (people with mixing skills - I have some - could take some French songs and mix them, one new mp3 every week or so). This is the kind of stuff that will keep people visiting our site.<br /><br />- <span style="font-weight: bold">Contests</span>, for instance a vote 'best French song of the year award'<br /><br />Voila this is the basic stuff I had in mind for FrenchScene.Net. It's obvious that we will need 'a team' to make this kind of content. <br /><br />New ideas and comments are welcome!</div>
